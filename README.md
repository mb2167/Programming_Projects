## Project Overview

This GitHub hosts a collection of personal projects exploring physics through computational simulations:

- **Fluid Simulation:** Experimenting with the dynamics of liquids and gases using computational fluid dynamics techniques.  
- **N-Body Simulation:** Simulating gravitational interactions between multiple bodies to observe orbital dynamics and emergent behaviours.  
- **Quantum Tunnelling Simulation:** Exploring quantum tunnelling, where particles can traverse potential barriers, through numerical simulation and visualisation.

These projects are driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, providing a space to experiment, explore, and share insights in physics and computational modelling.

**Current Progress:**  
- Initial planning stage; no substantial implementation yet.  

**Goals:**  
- Develop a basic fluid simulation capturing fundamental fluid dynamics such as flow, diffusion, and simple interactions.  
- Explore numerical methods like grid-based solvers or particle-based techniques to model fluids realistically.

**Current Progress:**  
- Implemented a basic N-body simulation with multiple bodies orbiting under mutual gravitational attraction.  
- Created a fragmentation score system, which determines the amount of mass that fragments upon a collision; this system has not yet been implemented.  

**Goals:**  
- Extend the simulation to handle collisions and merging of bodies.  
- Expand upon the fragmentation system, adding limits for which bodies merge and handling relatively small-mass bodies.  
- Explore optimisations for larger numbers of bodies and visualisation of complex orbital patterns.

**Current Progress:**  
- Conceptual planning stage; no significant code implementation yet.  

**Goals:**  
- Develop simulations for arbitrary potential barriers.  
- Accurately model particle behaviour using quantum mechanics principles and numerical methods such as the finite difference method.  
- Visualise tunnelling probabilities and wavefunction dynamics.

# Programming Projects  
Personal programming projects for physics-based simulations

---

## Project Overview  
This repository hosts a collection of personal projects exploring physics through computational simulation.  
Each project is driven by curiosity, a passion for learning, and the goal of combining theoretical physics with computational implementation.

- **Fluid Simulation:** Experimenting with the dynamics of liquids and gases using computational fluid dynamics techniques.  
- **N-Body Simulation:** Simulating gravitational interactions among multiple bodies to observe orbital dynamics and emergent behaviours.  
- **Quantum Tunnelling Simulation:** Exploring quantum tunnelling, where particles traverse potential barriers, using numerical simulation and visualisation.
